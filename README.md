# hello-world
well hello there. 
my name is jarod.
i have been obsessed with computers and technology for about as far back as i can remember.
i hope that learning coding will help intersect my loves of computers/tech, music and video games.
i make a pretty decent chicken tikka masala
im a proud dog-father of two pretty flippin cute dachschund-boston terrier pups, named Cain and Abel
i have been working in the food service industry for seven plus years now, i currently bartend at an oyster bar in downtown raleigh
although i enjoy my job as a bartender, im ready for a "better late than never" career change into the world of coding, and my hope is that free code camp will help jumpstart that career.
